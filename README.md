# Note Taker

## Description

The Note Taker application is a simple web tool that allows users to write and save notes. It provides a simple interface for keeping track of tasks or managing information. The application uses an Express.js backend and stores note data in a JSON file. This project was created to demonstrate the build of a full-stack web application, combining front-end and back-end development.

## Usage

To use the Note Taker application, follow these steps:

Open the application by accessing the landing page, where you will see a link to the notes page. Click on the link to navigate to the notes page.

On the notes page, the left column displays a list of existing notes. The right column provides empty fields to enter a new note's title and text.

To create a new note, enter a title and the note's text in the input fields.

A Save icon will appear in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

Click on the Save icon to save the new note. The note will be stored and added to the list in the left column, along with the existing notes.

To view an existing note, click on the note's title in the list displayed.
